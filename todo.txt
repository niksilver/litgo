To do
-----

Sections
- Keep track of a contents list (section and its name)
- Add a directive for including the contents list
- Link from each section reference to the section
- Warning when a section jumps a level (e.g. 1 to 3, or nothing to 2)

Chunks
- Write out the chunk name before each chunk.
- Make chunk starts linkable.

Refactoring

Chapters
- Follow chapter links and compile chapters.
  - Have a command line flag to say if the markdown file is book with chapters
  - If reading chapters, makes sure to read a sequence of files.
  - If reading chapters, preserve the section number between successive
    files... but make sure the filename changes.
- Allow links between chapters.

Directives
- Add a dummy "ignore" directive just to make sure line numbers
  don't get corrupted.
